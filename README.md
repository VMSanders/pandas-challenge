GTPE Data Science Boot Camp Module 4 Challenge - Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks

This repository includes 2 folders: .ipynb_checkpoints (automatically generated by Jupyter) and Resources
The Resources folder is pulled from the Module 4 class directory, containing csv files with the information to analyze, a starter Jupyter notebook, and some images.

The repository also contains a Jupyter Notebook file called PyCitySchools, which pulls information from the csv files in Resources and forms them into Pandas dataframes for analysis.
