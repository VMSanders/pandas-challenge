    "In terms of average scores and % passing students, small and medium schools tend to perform better than large schools. I attended both small and large schools, and that about lines up with my personal experience. Larger schools may not necessarily have the resources to devote to the number of students they support.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, performance remains about the same between grades - students don't tend to do better or worse as they move through the grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charter schools also tend to perform much better than district schools. Charter schools make up all top 5 of the best performing schools by score, and district schools make up all top 5 of the worst performing. I looked this up out of curiosity, but some often stated reasons for charter schools' higher performance are smaller sizes (in line with paragraph 1) and flexibility/speed in adopting new educational processes that may be more effective. My thought is that such flexibility may also make the charter schools a more attractive option for skilled teachers - I've definitely heard teachers complain about having their hands tied by all the (ineffective) hoops they're made to jump through by public schools and feeling less interested in teaching in such an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, schools with lower budget per student tend to perform better than schools with higher budget per student. I might've initially assumed otherwise. I'm considering this along with the charter school points above. My quick online search tells me that charter schools often have smaller budgets than public schools, though this goes along with smaller student populations. As a result, charter schools sometimes end up having to do more fundraising activities. My thought is that this school system, with these requirements and student population caps, might bring in more parents who have the time/financial flexibility to work around the charter school requirements. Parents in these situations would probably also have more resources at home to devote to their children's educations.\n",
